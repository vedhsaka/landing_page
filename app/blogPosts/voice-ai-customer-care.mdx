# How Voice AI is Transforming Customer Service

We have all been on the receiving end of bad customer support. One of the worst experiences is navigating through the painful IVR system, pressing 1s and 2s and 3s just to reach a human. And finally after an endless wait time - the support agent says - "We are unable to reproduce (or) diagnose your issue. We will get back to you shortly."

And that - right there is where we all give up. We think the issue will take a long time to be fixed and it leads to frustration. Unhappy customer.
Businesses cannot afford unhappy customers. It's one thing to not be able to build all the features a customer wants - but its a whole other to have an unhappy customer because they are not able to use the existing features. 

A lot of the second category of unhappy customers can be converted to happy ones with good customer support. But building good customer support is a process. It requires very skilled members, who are empathetic and have strong product knowledge. They easily understand customer pains, help them solve it with existing solutions - or find workarounds for them. Pain releived = happy customer.

But the challenge is reaching the customer support agent. Human support agents are finite resources. They can work for a finite amount of time - and finite number of days.

Imagine a world where every customer query could interact efficiently with a support representative. No more navigating the treacherous world of IVR, pressing 1's and 2's and waiting. 

Yes - intelligent agents are on the rise. They are AI powered bots trained on a company's data. All knowing entities - within the scope of the organization. Imagine interacting with an AI bot that knows all the features available to the customer. It could probably give you suggestions to mitigate your problems very quickly. Or it could perfom the initial prognosis before passing if off to a human support agent. 

A lot of organizations are experimenting with conversational AI bots for customer service and are experiencing great results.

Let's look at what *Conversational AI* is and why organizations are opting for Conversational Voice AI bots! 


### Conversational AI

Conversational AI refers to a form of Artificial Intelligence that simulates and mimicks human like conversation. The conversational AI systems leverage Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to interact and respond to humans in a way that feels innately like a human conversation. Hence the name. 
It is supposed to blur the distinction between interacting with a machine versus a human. 

Conversational AI systems could be chat bots (text interactions) or voice bots (voice interaction). They are built with a goal of providing a simpler, more intutive way of interacting with computer systems. 

One of the most natural and significant places for applying conversational AI systems is in customer support.

Let's look at why it benefits the customer care industry


### Benefits of Conversational AI Voice bots for Customer Care

## Cost Effective

Traditional customer support teams require a large number of human agents, that need training, salaries, and other benefits. Voice bots, on the other hand, need just a one time set up and can handle numerous interactions simultaneously without additional costs. This makes it a cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes.


## 24 X 7 Availability

Voice Bots do not have finite working hours, do not need breaks or holidays. They are available to serve customers at all hours. This constant availability across all time zones is a huge positive factor for global businesses. It helps increase customer satisfaction which is always a key business goal. 


## High efficiency

Voice bots can handle rudimentary queries and troubleshooting with ease. They can run through a sequence of steps with the customer and diagnose basis issues quickly. This helps free up human time for more complex problems. Overall it helps increase the efficiency of customer support teams significantly. 




## Better Customer Experience

Voice Bots can have quick, efficient and positive interactions with customers leading to increased happiness among customers. They are programmed to have a friendly and professional demeanor, making customers feel more comfortable and understood. With immediate support, personalized interactions and quick resolutions -  customers are more likely to have a positive experience, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.


## Conclusion

Voice AI is by no means perfect at the moment. But it is definitely shaking things up in the world of Customer Support and it will continue to get better. We continue to observe positive impact on customers and businesses using AI for customer support and assistance. One thing is for certain - Voice AI bots are here to stay!
